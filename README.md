# Phase 2 Project

## Introduction
I discovered that if I think for too long on how to complete the objectives, I will never get anything done. This project that I made, is me reading through the requriements and creating pages based on the idea that first popped in my head.

### Learning Goals
- Build a React single page application from scratch
- Apply your knowledge of components, props and state management
- Incorporate client-side routing
- Use data from an API

### Project Requirements
1. You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.
2. Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized.
3. There should be at least 3 client-side routes using [React Router][1]. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes.
4. Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.
5. You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project.
6. Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from scratch, either by using [styled components][2] or writing CSS files and using id/className to style your elements. You can also incorporate a UI framework (like [React Bootstrap][3], [Semantic UI][4], or [Material UI][5]) if you prefer.

### Stretch Goals
1. Once you have met the minimum requirements, feel free to explore! These are only the basic requirements â€” you're free to add on as much stuff as you'd like. For example, you may want to incorporate data from an external API. Check out [this list of APIs](https://apilist.fun/) if you need some inspiration!

## REQUIRED Scripts
In the project directory, you must run:

### `npm i`
Installs all necessary packages needed to succesfully run project.

### `npm run server`
Runs a [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

When the json-server is running, open:\
[http://localhost:3001/user](http://localhost:3001/user)\
[http://localhost:3001/dogs](http://localhost:3001/dogs)\
[http://localhost:3001/reminders](http://localhost:3001/reminders)\
to view it in your browser.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
